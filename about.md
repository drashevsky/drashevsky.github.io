Hello ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my page! My name is Daniel, and I'm a software engineer interested in systems programming (Rust, C, etc.)

I am a generalist and visual learner. I like to spend my time tinkering with computers, reading nonfiction that's written like fiction, playing Go ([Baduk](https://www.learn-go.net/)), building crazy IRL contraptions / GitHub projects, stumbling around the Greater Seattle urban area, lurking on [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com), etc, etc.

## Some of my projects:

[TensorNote](https://drashevsky.github.io/tensornote/): a self-organizing notebook

[SketchTacToe](https://drashevsky.github.io/SketchTacToe-App/): a responsive tic-tac-toe game with SVG vector graphics and an AI

[Simulated CPU](https://github.com/drashevsky/SimulatedCPU): a 8 bit CPU design in a physics simulator

[BatchPong](https://github.com/drashevsky/BatchPong): Pong, but written in Windows Batch script ðŸ¤¯

## Explorations in startups:

[RigMonkey](https://rigmonkey.webflow.io): helping people build their next gaming PC (2021)

[EcoRare](ECORARE%20BUSINESS%20PLAN.pdf): a project for UW's Environmental Innovation Challenge (2023)
