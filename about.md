Hello ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my page! My name is Daniel, and I am a software engineer interested in systems programming (Rust, C, etc.) and fullstack development.

I would describe myself as a generalist and visual learner who likes tinkering with technology. Some of my interests include playing with computers, learning about the world around me, reading, playing Go ([Baduk](https://www.learn-go.net/)), posting stuff to Github, building RC aircraft, keeping up with emerging tech trends, etc, etc.
