Hello ðŸ‘‹ and welcome to my page! My name is Daniel, and I am a student at the University of Washington interested in systems programming (Rust, C, etc.) and fullstack development.

I would describe myself as a generalist and visual learner who likes tinkering with technology. Some of my interests include playing with computers, learning about the world around me, reading, playing Go ([Baduk](https://www.learn-go.net/)), posting stuff to Github, building RC aircraft, keeping up with emerging tech trends, etc, etc.  

If you are interested in my work, check out some recent projects below. Currently, this involves an exploration of [Second Brain](https://fortelabs.com/blog/basboverview/) productivity tools as I build [TensorNote](https://github.com/drashevsky/tensornote)!

## Personal Projects:

[TensorNote](https://github.com/drashevsky/tensornote): a self-organizing notebook

[Simulated CPU](https://github.com/drashevsky/SimulatedCPU): a 8 bit CPU design in a physics simulator
