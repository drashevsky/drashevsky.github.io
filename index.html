            <a href="posts/IvoryTower.html">Renovating the Ivory Tower</a> â€” Sat, 20 Jul 2024
        </h3>
        <p>Let&#39;s be honest. Academia these days is floundering.

Research into breakthroughs such as immunotherapy and RNA vaccines ends up being overlooked where it could otherwise have impacted millions of lives. [&hellip;]</p>

These energetic people are bursting at the seams with thoughts, ideas, commentary, newly learned subjects, and more. It becomes hard to stay on top of things due to <strong>information overload</strong>: the exponentially rising difficulty and time commitment of organizing large amounts of diverse information across different services/platforms.
