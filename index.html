            <a href="posts/DigitalHawala.html">Half-Baked Ideas - Digital Hawala</a> — Sun, 16 Feb 2025
        </h3>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawala">Hawala</a> is an informal money transmission system popular in the Middle East, Africa, and India. At its most basic, it relies on two reputable brokers establishing ties with each other, and agreeing to deliver their own money to recipients upon request. A sender can then ask one broker to send money to somebody far away by depositing money, getting the broker to ask their counterparty broker to discharge their own funds, and then adding the deposited funds to the counterparty broker&#39;s &quot;balance&quot;. All for a fee. [&hellip;]</p>

        </h3>
        <p>Let&#39;s be honest. Academia these days is floundering. In the STEM world, real scientific advances are being stifled by the replication crisis, toxic environments within labs, PHD burnout, and the politics of grant writing. Research into breakthroughs such as immunotherapy and RNA vaccines ends up being overlooked where it could otherwise have impacted millions of lives. [&hellip;]</p>

        </h3>
        <p>Nobody disputes the usefulness of large language models. LLMs can do &quot;intellectual grunt work&quot;, such as suggesting a well-placed word for an essay or filling in the background of an artwork. This is a huge value add and breakthrough because it cuts the effort needed to produce a creative work in half, even if it makes mistakes (hallucinations). [&hellip;]</p>

            <a href="posts/SecondBrain.html">The Second Brain (Information Overload) Problem</a> — Mon, 18 Mar 2024
        </h3>
        <p>Smart people and entrepreneurs need to consume, generate, and process massive amounts of information these days to maximize their success in the knowledge economy. These energetic people are bursting at the seams with thoughts, ideas, commentary, newly learned subjects, and more. It becomes hard to stay on top of things due to <strong>information overload</strong>: the exponentially rising difficulty and time commitment of organizing large amounts of diverse information across different services/platforms.
